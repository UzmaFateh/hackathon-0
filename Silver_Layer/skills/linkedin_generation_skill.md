# Skill: LinkedIn Generation

## Purpose
Generate professional LinkedIn posts from business content in the vault.

## Inputs
- Source content: Path to approved content file
- Post type: Announcement/Insight/Question/Story
- Target audience: Professional/Technical/General
- Tone: Professional/Casual/Inspirational

## Outputs
- LinkedIn post text (max 3000 characters)
- Hashtags (3-5 relevant tags)
- Call-to-action (optional)
- Engagement hooks (questions, polls)

## Process

1. **Analyze Source Content**
   - Read the approved content file
   - Extract key messages and value propositions
   - Identify main themes and takeaways

2. **Determine Post Structure**
   - **Announcement**: News/launch format with clear CTA
   - **Insight**: Thought leadership with actionable advice
   - **Question**: Engagement-focused with open-ended question
   - **Story**: Narrative format with personal/business journey

3. **Generate Post Content**
   - Hook (first 2 lines to grab attention)
   - Body (main content with line breaks for readability)
   - Value proposition (what reader gains)
   - Call-to-action (next step for reader)

4. **Add Engagement Elements**
   - Relevant hashtags (research trending tags)
   - Question to encourage comments
   - Tag relevant people/companies (if applicable)

5. **Format for LinkedIn**
   - Use line breaks for readability
   - Emojis sparingly (1-3 max)
   - Keep paragraphs short (2-3 lines)
   - Bold key points if needed

## Success Criteria
- Post is under 3000 characters
- Hook is compelling and relevant
- Content provides clear value
- CTA is specific and actionable
- Hashtags are relevant and not excessive

## Error Handling
- **Source content too long**: Summarize key points
- **Unclear message**: Request clarification or use generic template
- **Missing context**: Add disclaimer or request more info

## Examples

### Example 1: Product Launch
**Input:** Marketing plan for AI Employee system

**Output:**
```
🚀 Excited to share: We've built an AI Employee system that actually works.

After 6 months of development, here's what we learned:

→ Human-in-the-loop isn't optional—it's essential
→ Simple automation beats complex AI 80% of the time
→ Documentation is your competitive advantage

The system handles:
• Email triage and routing
• Content generation and scheduling
• Project planning and tracking

All while keeping humans in control of key decisions.

Interested in AI automation that respects human judgment?

### Example 2: Insight Post
**Input:** Blog post about human-AI collaboration

**Output:**
```
Most AI tools fail because they try to replace humans.

The best ones amplify human judgment instead.

Here's the difference:

❌ Replace: AI makes all decisions
✅ Amplify: AI prepares, human decides

❌ Replace: Fully autonomous systems
✅ Amplify: Human-in-the-loop workflows

❌ Replace: Black box algorithms
✅ Amplify: Transparent, auditable processes

We've been testing this approach for 6 months.

Result? 5 hours saved per day, zero loss of control.

What's your experience with AI tools?
Do they help or get in the way?
