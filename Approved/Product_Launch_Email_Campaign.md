**Subject:** We're live: Your AI Employee is ready to work

Hi [First Name],

After months of development and testing, we're thrilled to announce: **AI Employee is officially live**.

**What is AI Employee?**

It's an intelligent automation platform that handles your routine tasks while keeping you in control. Think of it as having a tireless assistant who:

✓ Triages your inbox and prioritizes what matters
✓ Generates reports and status updates automatically
✓ Manages your calendar and scheduling
✓ Handles data entry and routine workflows
✓ Escalates complex decisions to you for approval

**The difference? Transparency and control.**

Unlike other automation tools, AI Employee keeps you in the loop. Every action is logged. Complex decisions come to you. You approve before anything critical happens.

**Early adopters are already seeing results:**

## Email 2: Problem/Solution Focus

**Send Date:** Monday, Feb 24 @ 10:00 AM
**Subject Line Options:**
1. "You're wasting 16 hours per week (here's how to stop)"
2. "The hidden cost of 'just 5 minutes'"
3. "[First Name], what would you do with 20 extra hours?"

**Preheader:** Most professionals spend 40% of their time on tasks that could be automated.

**Email Body:**

---

**Subject:** You're wasting 16 hours per week (here's how to stop)

Hi [First Name],

Let me ask you something:

How much time did you spend last week on:
• Sorting and responding to routine emails?
• Scheduling meetings back and forth?
• Generating status reports?
• Entering data into spreadsheets?
• Updating project trackers?

If you're like most professionals, the answer is **about 16 hours**.

That's 40% of your work week spent on tasks that could be automated.

**The real cost isn't just time—it's opportunity.**

Every hour spent on routine work is an hour you're NOT spending on:
- Strategic thinking
- Creative problem-solving
- Building relationships
- Growing your skills
- Actually living your life

**This is exactly why we built AI Employee.**

It handles the repetitive work autonomously while keeping you in control of what matters.

**Here's what happens when you start using it:**

**Week 1:** You set up your first workflows (takes about 30 minutes)
**Week 2:** AI Employee starts handling routine tasks automatically
**Week 3:** You notice you're spending less time on email and admin
**Week 4:** You've reclaimed 10-15 hours and wonder how you ever worked without it

**See it in action:**

## Email 3: Social Proof & Case Study

**Subject Line Options:**
1. "How Sarah saved 15 hours per week (real results)"
2. "Case study: 75% less admin work in 30 days"
3. "This consultant automated her entire workflow"

**Preheader:** Real results from an early adopter who transformed her business.

**Email Body:**

---

**Subject:** How Sarah saved 15 hours per week (real results)

Hi [First Name],

Meet Sarah.

She's a solo consultant managing 5 clients, juggling proposals, reports, invoices, and endless email threads.

**Before AI Employee:**
- 60+ hours per week
- Drowning in admin work
- No time for business development
- Constantly stressed about dropping balls

**After AI Employee (30 days later):**
- 45 hours per week
- Admin work handled automatically
- 15 hours freed up for client work and growth
- Sleeping better at night

**What changed?**

Sarah set up AI Employee to handle:

1. **Email triage** — Routine emails sorted and prioritized automatically
2. **Client reporting** — Weekly status reports generated from project data
3. **Invoice tracking** — Payment reminders sent automatically
4. **Meeting scheduling** — Calendar managed without the back-and-forth
5. **Data entry** — Time logs and expenses recorded automatically

**The result?**

"I got my life back. I'm working fewer hours, making more money, and actually enjoying my work again. AI Employee is like having a full-time assistant for a fraction of the cost."

— Sarah K., Solo Consultant

**Her advice for getting started?**

"Start small. Pick one annoying task and automate it. Once you see it working, you'll want to automate everything."

**Ready to get your time back?**

You've got nothing to lose and 15 hours per week to gain.

Cheers,
The AI Employee Team

## Email 4: Objection Handler

**Send Date:** Thursday, Feb 27 @ 11:00 AM
**Subject Line Options:**
1. "Is AI Employee right for you? (honest answer)"
2. "3 reasons NOT to use AI Employee"
3. "Let's address the elephant in the room"

**Preheader:** Common concerns about AI automation—and our honest answers.

**Email Body:**

---

**Subject:** Is AI Employee right for you? (honest answer)

Hi [First Name],

I've noticed you haven't started your trial yet.

That's totally fine. AI automation isn't for everyone.

But I wanted to address some common concerns we hear, in case they're holding you back:

**"I don't trust AI to make decisions for me."**

Good. You shouldn't.

That's why AI Employee uses a "human-in-the-loop" approach. It handles routine tasks autonomously, but escalates complex decisions to you. You're always in control.

Every action is logged. You can review, override, or adjust anything. It's transparent by design.

**"I don't have time to set this up."**

Fair concern. But here's the reality:

Initial setup takes about 30 minutes. After that, AI Employee saves you 10-15 hours per week.

That's a 30x return on your time investment in the first week alone.

Plus, we offer a free onboarding session to help you get started quickly.

**"What if it makes mistakes?"**

It will. Just like any assistant (human or AI).

The difference? AI Employee learns from corrections. The more you use it, the better it gets at understanding your preferences and priorities.

And remember: it asks before doing anything critical. You approve the important stuff.

**"This sounds too good to be true."**

I get it. We're skeptical too.

That's why we offer a 30-day free trial with no credit card required. Try it. If it doesn't save you at least 10 hours in the first month, don't pay for it.

Simple as that.

**Still on the fence?**

[Book a 15-Minute Demo Call →]

We'll show you exactly how it works and answer any questions you have. No pressure, no sales pitch.

Either way, I hope this helps clarify what AI Employee is (and isn't).

Best,
[Founder Name]
Founder, AI Employee
